### Note:  Within the 'config' folder, the file 'default.json' has missing values - as I'd like to keep my database connection private.
### You'll need to have a MongoDB Atlas account (for free) with a collection named 'foodbanks'


### I've removed all of the "node_modules" as well -- you'll need to open the main folder in your terminal and type "npm i" or "npm install"

### Please let me know if you have any issues.





### To run this application - you must have Node.js installed (most recent version).
### --- In a terminal, navigate to this folder, and type "npm install"
### --- Once all has installed, type "npm run dev"   (this runs the server + client from one terminal, using a package named 'Concurrently')
